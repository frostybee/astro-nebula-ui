The Learning Objectives component helps educators clearly communicate what students will achieve in a lesson. It features a clean, professional design with optional interactive progress tracking.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple learning objectives panel:

<LearningObjectives
  objectives={[
    "Understand the fundamentals of web development",
    "Learn how to create responsive layouts",
    "Master CSS Grid and Flexbox",
    "Build accessible web applications"
  ]}
/>

```astro

import { LearningObjectives } from 'astro-nebula-ui';

<LearningObjectives
  objectives={[
    "Understand the fundamentals of web development",
    "Learn how to create responsive layouts",
    "Master CSS Grid and Flexbox",
    "Build accessible web applications"
  ]}
/>
```

## Interactive Mode

Enable interactive mode to allow students to check off completed objectives:

<LearningObjectives
  title="JavaScript Fundamentals"
  objectives={[
    "Declare and use variables effectively",
    "Write and call functions",
    "Work with arrays and objects",
    "Handle events and user interactions"
  ]}
  interactive={true}
  showProgress={true}
/>

```astro
<LearningObjectives
  title="JavaScript Fundamentals"
  objectives={[
    "Declare and use variables effectively",
    "Write and call functions",
    "Work with arrays and objects",
    "Handle events and user interactions"
  ]}
  interactive={true}
  showProgress={true}
/>
```

## Variants

The component supports different visual styles:

### Default Variant
<LearningObjectives
  title="Default Style"
  objectives={["First objective", "Second objective", "Third objective"]}

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Styling

You can customize the appearance by overriding CSS variables:

```css
.learning-objectives {
  --learning-objectives-accent: #your-color;
  --learning-objectives-bg: #your-background;
}
```

### Multiple Instances

The component supports multiple instances on the same page, each with independent progress tracking:

<LearningObjectives
  title="Week 1 Goals"
  objectives={["Learn HTML basics", "Understand CSS selectors"]}
  interactive={true}
  id="week-1"
/>

<LearningObjectives
  title="Week 2 Goals"
  objectives={["Master JavaScript variables", "Create interactive elements"]}
  interactive={true}
  id="week-2"
/>

## Best Practices

1. **Keep objectives specific and measurable** - Use action verbs like "identify", "create", "analyze"
2. **Limit to 3-7 objectives** - Too many can overwhelm students
3. **Use consistent language** - Start each objective with similar verb tenses
4. **Make them achievable** - Ensure objectives match lesson content and difficulty
5. **Place at lesson start** - Students should know what they'll learn before beginning

## Examples in Educational Context

<LearningObjectives
  title="Course Introduction - What You'll Master"
  objectives={[
    "Navigate the learning platform effectively",
    "Understand course structure and expectations",
    "Connect with classmates and instructors",
    "Set up your development environment",
    "Complete your first coding exercise"
  ]}
  interactive={true}
  showProgress={true}
  variant="default"
/>

### Technical Lesson
<LearningObjectives
  title="Database Design Principles"
  objectives={[
    "Design normalized database schemas",
    "Implement primary and foreign key relationships",

  ]}
  interactive={true}
  showProgress={true}
